## Introduction

This project is part of [FIWARE](http://fiware.org). You will find more information abour this FIWARE GE [here](http://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/pep-proxy-wilma).

Thanks to this component and together with Identity Management and Authorization PDP GEs, you will add authentication and authorization security to your backend applications. Thus, only FIWARE users will be able to access your GEs or REST services. But you will be able also to manage specific permissions and policies to your resources allowing different access levels to your users.

## API Overview

Requests to proxy should be made with a special HTTP Header: X-Auth-Token. 
This header contains the OAuth access token obtained from FI-WARE IDM GE.

Example of request:

<pre>
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: proxy_host
X-Auth-Token:z2zXk...ANOXvZrmvxvSg
</pre>

To test the proxy you can generate this request running the following command:

<pre>
curl --header "X-Auth-Token:z2zXk...ANOXvZrmvxvSg" http://proxy_host
</pre>

Once authenticated, the forwarded request will include additional HTTP headers with user info:

<pre>
X-Nick-Name: nickname of the user in IdM
X-Display-Name: display name of user in IdM
X-Roles: roles of the user in IdM
X-Organizations: organizations in IdM
</pre>
